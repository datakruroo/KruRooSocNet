\title{Analyze ego-alter similarity for continuous attributes using correlation approach}
\usage{
analyze_continuous_similarity(
  adj_matrix,
  node_attributes,
  attribute_col,
  directed = TRUE,
  self_ties = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix}{An adjacency matrix representing network ties}

\item{node_attributes}{A data frame containing node attributes}

\item{attribute_col}{The name of the continuous attribute column to analyze (e.g., "age", "tenure")}

\item{directed}{Logical, whether the network is directed. Default is TRUE}

\item{self_ties}{Logical, whether to include self ties. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
- absolute difference between ego's attribute and average alters' attribute
- correlation between ego's connection to alters and absolute difference
- correlation between ego's connection to alters and squared difference
- correlation between ego's connection to alters and identity coefficient
}

\examples{
# Create sample adjacency matrix
friendship_matrix <- matrix(
  c(0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1),
  nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE
)
rownames(friendship_matrix) <- colnames(friendship_matrix) <- paste0("P", 1:4)

# Create sample attributes
attributes <- data.frame(
  node = paste0("P", 1:4),
  tenure = c(5, 3, 8, 2)
)

# Analyze similarity based on tenure
analyze_continuous_similarity(
  friendship_matrix,
  attributes,
  "tenure"
)
